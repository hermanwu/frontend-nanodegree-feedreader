# Purpose of this project

1. Learn how to use Jasmine Behavior-Driven Javascript library to write test script.
2. Practise "test-driven developement".
3. Underand business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM 
Mnipulation.



## What will I learn?

You will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## How will this help my career?

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.


# How will I complete this project?

1. Download the [required project assets](http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).
2. Review the functionality of the application within your browser.
3. Explore the application's HTML (*./index.html*), CSS (*./css/style.css*) and JavaScript (*./js/app.js*) to gain an understanding of how it works.
4. Explore the Jasmine spec file in *./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js*
5. Edit the allFeeds variable in *./js/app.js* to make the provided test fail and see how Jasmine visualizes this failure in your application.
6. Return the allFeeds variable to a passing state.
7. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
8. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
9. Write a new test suite named "The menu".
10. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.
11. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
12. Write a test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container. Remember, loadFeed() is asynchronous so this test wil require the use of Jasmine's beforeEach and asynchronous done() function.
13. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes. Remember, loadFeed() is asynchronous.
14. When complete - all of your tests should pass.
